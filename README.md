# Scooperla
Scooperla was founded in 2023 by a group of students attending HCI class at Bowdoin College. We aim to serve the best ice cream with bold flavor, smooth consistency, and top-notch quality with a much more affordable price than the only ice cream shop (Gelato Fiasco) in Brunswick. We source our whole milk and cream from dairy farms in Scotland to support global business. The milk from these highland cattle are known to have high butterfat content. However, our company does not take any responsibility for the increased risk of obesity, heart disease, or cancer.
